        <p>
            It is an irony that the country which prides itself on its digital initiatives like UPI cotinues to record the maxinum number of Internet Shutdowns acrosss the world. Internet shutdowns have varied impacts on different segments of the population, Much of the impact of Internet shutdowns goes undocumented. The year 2022 saw India take over the presidency of G20 and at the same time saw the highest number of shutdowns for another year in row. The reasons for shutting down the Internet 75 times this year have ranged from prevention of cheating in exams, countering communal tensions to terrorism. 
            The year also saw the attempt at duplication of a colonial era legislation in the form of the Indian Telecommunication Bill 2022. The bill which does not improve the legal framework for internet shutdowns in the country. 
            There is a complete absence of state maintained documentation of Internet shutdowns leading to the onus falling on civil society organisations like SFLC.in to maintain the count. On a positive side, this year has also seen significant legal challenges and policy developments in the area which are expected to change the jurisprudence of Internet Shutdowns in the country. 

            The Internet Shutdowns Tracker has been the key resource for this report, being the only real time tracker that maintains documentation around Internet Shutdowns in the country. The report has emerged from the year around documentation that the tracker maintains. This report aims to educate its audience on the numbers around Internet Shutdowns, the impact of these shutdowns, the laws and policies governing shutdowns, the major developments around shutdowns in 2022 and to provide recommendations  for better governance in this area. 

            This Report is a continuous part of SFLC.in’s efforts against arbitrary internet shutdowns. In addition to understanding the law which sanctions internet shutdowns and the issues which arise within it, the Report also attempts to provide information that brings forth the intensity, extent, and impact of internet shutdowns. The report has been designed to serve as a resource for lawmakers and citizens alike, with the objective of shedding some light into the issue of internet shutdowns in India.

        <h2>
            <em>Introduction</em>
        </h2>
        <p>The advent of the democratizing and decentralized structure of the
            internet birthed the creation of a parallel social structure, which has
            merged over time with the
            <em>real</em>
            word. The extension of human
            activities in the digital realm, and the increasing expansion of the
            virtual world, has blurred the lines between the two worlds, with
            simultaneous human existence in both. We use the internet, for example,
            to hail a taxi virtually and pay for it online, to commute in the real
            world. We use our virtual identities to buy and hold digital assets,
            with which we purchase tangible products. The internet has affected how
            we exercise our rights in a participatory democracy. The “modern public
            square” that is the internet, has empowered an individual “to become a
            town crier with a voice that resonates farther than it could from any
            soapbox”<span class="footnote" id="1">
              Packingham v North Carolina, 582 U.S.___(2017)
            </span>. As the ultimate currency to access
            essential and non-essential services, and to exercise constitutionally
            protected fundamental rights, arbitrary disruptions in accessing the
            internet hamper access to said services and rights. Therefore, strict
            scrutiny of the exercise of Executive powers to block internet access is
            a
            <em>sine qua non</em>
            to due process in any democratic society.
            Despite this, in 2021, with 101 shutdowns, India ranked first in the
            list of countries with the highest number of internet shutdowns in the
            world.</p>
        <p>This Report is a part of SFLC.in’s continuous efforts against arbitrary internet shutdowns. It aims to serve as a resource which allows a comprehensive understanding of internet shutdowns in India, and the impact they have on individual rights and the society. It also studies and scrutinizes the legal framework related to internet shutdowns. The Report has been designed to serve as a resource for citizens and lawmakers alike, to both bring to the fore the harsh truth around internet shutdowns, and to provide a springboard to better protect rights on the internet.</p>
        <p>It is essential to first grasp the extent and frequency of 
            internet shutdowns before stressing on the urgency to
            take corrective steps. This is done in Chapter 1 of this Report, using data from SFLC.in’s Internet Shutdowns Tracker, which has been following
            every single internet shutdown in India since 2012. In the interest of
            complete transparency and authenticity, the methodology behind
            maintaining the tracker is also laid out. The Chapter also lays out an
            analysis which enables a fuller understanding of internet shutdowns in India-the reasons cited by the
            Government for imposing internet shutdowns, nature of shutdowns
            (preventive or reactive), nature of services suspended, state-wise
            distribution of shutdowns and duration of shutdowns.</p>
        <p>The impact of internet shutdowns, albeit drastic, is fragmented and
            poorly recorded. In Chapter 2, the adverse impacts of shutdowns are
            highlighted, statistically where possible, with particular focus on
            human rights, the economy, education, and healthcare. As aspects in
            which minority and underprivileged groups feel the impact most
            significantly, these areas were isolated and studied. Chapter 3 of the
            Report identifies the legal framework which
            <em>enables</em>
            internet
            shutdowns. The high ranking of India on the shutdowns index, and
            compounding abuse of rights in this regard over the years, is an
            indicator of statutory defects and weak accountability measures. In
            Chapter 4, the Report studies contemporary policy and legal developments
            in India on internet shutdowns, with the intent of developing a
            foresight into India’s approach towards them.</p>
        <p>Chapter 5 of the Report is a stakeholder analysis to understand the role of and impact on each element of the current social order in the context of internet shutdowns. The relationship between each of these elements is crucial in understanding the distribution of power and rights, which in turn enables a clearer understanding of the points at which changes can be brought about to mitigate the problems which arise out of arbitrary shutdowns. In essence, it sheds a light on the role which each stakeholder can play to prevent the abuse of
            rights, and allows us to get a clearer picture of standards of accountability applicable to each stakeholder. The map also provides insight into how SFLC.in specifically interacts with each element.</p>
            
        <p>As a civil society organization, one of the stakeholders mentioned in
            Chapter 5, SFLC.in bears an important responsibility of ensuring that
            constitutionally guaranteed rights are protected.</p>
        <p>The Report in Chapter 6 concludes with an assessment of the different
            resources above, reading them as whole to locate key areas of
            development which can restrict the arbitrary exercise of powers and
            ensure continued access to the internet. SFLC.in remains committed in
            its efforts to disable the weaponization of ‘access to internet’, and to
            ensure unfettered and lawful access for all.</p>

            <h2>
                <em>The Internet Shutdowns Tracker</em>
            </h2>
            <p>SFLC.in maintains an Internet Shutdowns Tracker (IST) which can be
                accessed at
                <a style="font-size: 12pt !important;" href="https://internetshutdowns.in/">https://internetshutdowns.in/</a>.
                    This flagship project of the organization is a repository of every
                    single traceable internet shutdown imposed in India since 2012. This
                    real time record, the only database of its kind in India, yields data
                    essential for an analysis of the incursion of right to access the
                    internet, and the right to freedom of speech and expression on the
                    internet, in India.</p>
            
            <h3>What is an internet shutdown?</h3>
            
            <p>For the purposes of the tracker, we define an internet shutdown as
                <em>“a Government imposed disablement of access to the internet as a
                    whole, in a particular locality, or localities, for any duration of
                    time</em>”. The Internet Shutdowns Tracker has recorded a total of 690
                    shutdowns in India since 2012. The first recorded shutdown was imposed
                    in the then State of Jammu and Kashmir on January 26, 2012 (‘Republic
                    Day’).</p>
            
            <h3>
                The Internet Shutdowns Tracker : How does it work?
            </h3>
            
            <p>As mentioned above, the Internet Shutdowns Tracker is a real time
                tracker.The information is sourced through the news, local and national
                media, and publicly available internet shutdown orders issued by the
                respective state governments. There is also a
                <em>citizen reporting
                    mechanism</em>
                available at the Tracker website which can be used by the
                citizens to report any instances of Internet shutdowns in the country.
                SFLC.in also receives reports from citizens on our various social media
                handles.</p>
            <p>All reports received are put through a rigorous cross-verification
                process by the team to verify the authenticity of the report. Apart from
                public engagement for this, routine applications under the Right to
                Information Act, 2005 (hereinafter "RTI Act"; “RTI applications”) are
                filed with the order-issuing authority to obtain details about the
                shutdown. The Act allows citizens to seek information from government
                departments, which the department must respond to within thirty days
                <span class="footnote" id="2">
                  The Right to Information, 2005, s. 6
                </span>.
            </p>
            <p>SFLC.in files applications for each shutdown where an order is not
                publicly available. Further, blanket applications are also filed with
                the central and state governments to furnish all orders issued between
                certain periods of time (say, January 20xx to March 20xx). This is done
                to ensure that shutdowns which were not reported in the news, or about
                which we have received no intimation, are also documented. This also
                acts as a step of verification for the information already available on
                the Tracker.</p>
            <p>It is pertinent to note that, SFLC.in counts each order suspending
                internet as a separate internet shutdown. This metric of measurement is
                important, since in a few instances where consecutive shutdowns are
                imposed, they are reported in the news as one shutdown. The metric put
                in place by SFLC.in ensure that such inaccuracy is avoided. Furthermore,
                there are instances when news reports or citizen reports of internet
                shutdowns are ambiguous in the duration for which the shutdown has been
                imposed. In these situations, changes are retrospectively made to the
                Tracker upon verification. Retrospective adjustment to the Tracker is
                also made when copies of the orders are released
                <em>ex post</em>
                the
                shutdown.</p>

            <h3>Internet Shutdowns in India</h3>
            
            <p>Using the data recorded on our Tracker, the following graphical
                representations were prepared to provide an overview of the state of
                shutdowns in India. SFLC.in has also added an annexure to this Report
                (Annexure 1), which presents all applications filed under the Right to
                Information Act, 2005, requesting details about the internet shutdowns
                imposed by various authorities. Access to this information is crucial in
                the assessment of the legitimacy of the internet shutdown imposed, and
                to identify procedural and substantive issues in the process of imposing
                internet shutdowns. It is recommended that the data below be read with
                the information available in Annexure 1 of the Report to materialize a
                wholesome understanding of the
                <em>status quo</em>
                of internet shutdowns
                in India.</p>
            <p>Later in the Report, in Chapter 3 , in the context of the data
                presented above and the information provided in Annexure 1, we have
                studied the issues we which arise in documentation of internet shutdowns
                in India.</p>

                        shutdowns are imposed when an unsavoury event has already taken place to avoid more conflict. For example, Suspension of the Internet when rioting has already taken place to prevent the spreading of rumours.

            <h3>Lost Voices</h3>

            <p>In order to study the impact of internet shutdowns on citizens,
                SFLC.in also maintains empirical records in the form of testimonials by
                those who have been affected by them. Through this project, called
                <em>Lost Voices</em>, we have come across stories, particularly from the
                    Kashmir region which suffered the harshest of internet shutdowns in
                    India (for 522 consecutive days). Inevitably, the loss of livelihood and
                    obstructions in pursuing educational or professional opportunities were
                    a fallout they suffered. More importantly, the shutdowns restricted
                    access to health and access to other essential services (such as
                    financial and banking services).</p>
            <p>SFLC.in, in a coalition with non-profit organisations and civil
                society groups, wrote to the Government appealing the restoration of
                high speed internet in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir on
                August 12, 2022. Subsequently, SFLC.in also wrote to Home Department of
                the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, imploring the urgent
                restoration of internet services in two parts of the region during the
                second wave of the deadly COVID-19 pandemic. Access to internet during
                the pandemic was essential, and the near-absolute dependence on it has
                been well documented. More importantly, community aid was made easier
                during this period due to the internet.</p>

                <em>Impact Assessment of Internet Shutdowns</em>
            </h2>
            <p>The expansion of the society and its structures into the digital
                realm has warranted a protection of rights in this new dimension as
                well. This has been judicially recognized in
                <em>Faheema Shirin R.K. v
                    The State of Kerala</em>
                <span class="footnote" id="3">2019 SCC OnLine Ker 2976</span>
                and
                <em>Anuradha Bhasin v Union of
                    India</em>
                <span class="footnote" id="4"> AIR 2020 SC 1308</span>, by the Honourable High Court of
                Kerala, and the Supreme Court of India has recognised that the exercise
                of certain fundamental rights is contingent on access to internet. More
                specifically, in
                <em>Faheema Shirin</em>, in which SFLC.in was impleaded
                    as a party, it was held that restricting access to internet violated
                    students’ rights to access information under Article 19(1)(a) of the
                    Constitution, and their rights to education and privacy under Article
                    19(1)(g).</p>
            <p>Arbitrary and disproportionate internet shutdowns violate these, and
                several other rights. In this section of the Report, the impact of
                internet shutdowns is studied, statistically in as far as possible, to
                highlight the scarring effect on the economy, healthcare, and
                education.</p>
            <h3>Economic Impact</h3>
            <p>Internet shutdowns come at an aggressive cost to the economy and
                economic stability. According to Top10VP report for the year 2022, India
                lost $174.6 million due to internet shutdowns<span class="footnote" id="5">
                  https://www.top10vpn.com/research/cost-of-internet-shutdowns/
                </span>.
                Long term shutdowns have drastic impacts on the livelihood of people and
                directly contribute to loss of employment. The region of Kashmir, which
                lost access to internet for over 18 months, is the worst hit state in
                India, in terms of economic impact. According to a report by Kashmir
                Chamber of Commerce and Industries, businesses have suffered losses
                worth Rupees 40,000 crore from 05 August 2019 to July 2020<span class="footnote" id="6">

                it was observed that internet shutdowns not only affect big traders,
                E-commerce, or big companies but an Internet blackout tends to equally
                impact even the smallest business which has any form of Internet
                dependence. We were able to speak to an operator at a service center
                from Mutnur village of Adilabad district who said, “Various business
                areas suffered when there was no internet for 30-45 days in our region.
                Our work includes filling of online applications, generating
                certificates like birth certificate, OBC certificate etc. Since we
                couldn’t do any bank transactions, our customers also faced a lot of
                inconveniences.”<span class="footnote" id="12">

                The impact on gig workers (food app
                delivery partners, drivers who are a part of cab aggregator services),
                who rely on the internet entirely to perform their services for their
                wages, suffer severely. Shutdowns prevent them from being able to render
                their services entirely.</p>

            <p>The Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations,
                in its report, observed that with increased digitization of health
                records and facilities, an internet shutdown impacts healthcare services
                as well. Many doctors rely on the internet for consultation with their
                peers, and patients also use the internet to consult doctors. These
                activities are normally hit due to internet shutdowns

                access difficulties faced by a doctor in Manipur during an internet
                shutdown. Apart from being able to access their server, issues were also
                faced in making payments, tracking shipments of medical supplies, and
                engage in other essential medi-care activities essential for delivering

            <p>Many government-provided health schemes for poor and vulnerable are
                affected by internet shutdowns, thereby, affecting access to healthcare.
                In early 2020 it was reported that many individuals who are
                beneficiaries of a government health scheme (Ayushman Bharat, a health
                insurance scheme for economically backward individuals) were not able to
                access healthcare as the hospitals were unable to deal with these cases
                due to internet blockade in Kashmir. Doctors stated that they were
                unable to process Ayushman Bharat cases for 25 days consecutively, after
                which they resorted to offline processes, which caused issues of
                efficiency and hampered delivery of services to beneficiaries. Access to
                free healthcare which was guaranteed under the scheme was obstructed due
                to prolonged internet shutdowns<span class="footnote" id="16">

            <h3>Impact on Education</h3>
            
            <p>Internet shutdowns have a severe impact on education. The importance
                of access to internet for the modern education sector became obvious
                with the online delivery of classes and administration of examinations
                during the COVID-19 pandemic across the world. It must be noted that
                over 96.33 percent of internet users in India are mobile internet
                users<span class="footnote" id="17">

            <p>With respect to long term internet shutdowns, it was observed that
                some students dropped out of schools or missed an entire year of
                schooling. In Kashmir it was reported that, due to low internet speed
                and connectivity issues the syllabus for the academic year had to be
                reduced by 40 percent<span class="footnote" id="19">

                this petition that an internet shutdown during a pandemic, particularly,

                is concerned. This was a decision arrived at after consideration offered
                by the Court to the desirability and convenience of access to internet
                in light of “a worldwide pandemic and a national lockdown”.<span class="footnote" id="25">

            <p>There are recorded incidents of students having had to appear for
                exams physically despite the pandemic. Students of Kurukshetra
                University, a renowned educational institution in the State of Haryana,
                had exams scheduled as a routine part of their curriculum during the
                pandemic. This schedule coincided with the “farmers protests’” in the
                State, in reaction to which shutdown orders were put in place from
                September 7-9, 2021. Subsequently, a statement was released by the
                Controller of Examinations of the University that students would either
                have to arrange broadband within a day, or write exams physically.
                SFLC.in wrote to the University administration, highlighting the
                arbitrariness of the instructions in the statement, and implored the
                postponement of the examinations, or extension of an alternative to the
                students. This case study is crucial in understanding the tangible
                impact, in this instance of health and safety of students, which were a

                <em>Legal Framework for Internet Shutdowns</em>
            </h2>
            <p>In India, the power to impose an internet shutdown, lies both with
                the Central and State governments. This is due to the federal structure
                adopted by the constitution, where public order, law and order and
                police are state subjects.<span class="footnote" id="27">

                Therefore, it has also
                been observed, that political context within a state plays a crucial
                role in internet shutdown decisions in the country.<span class="footnote" id="28">

                There are two laws which
                <em>enable</em>
                the state government to impose
                an internet shutdown.

                Pertinently, Section 144 has been
                sparingly used since the notification the Rules in August 2017.</p>

                </h3>
              
            <p>Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code gives power to a District
                Magistrate to “direct any person to abstain from a certain act or to
                take certain order with respect to certain property in his possession or
                under his management.” The grounds on which S. 144 can be invoked are:
                a) sufficient ground, b) requirement for immediate prevention, and c)
                speedy remedy to prevent a likely obstruction, annoyance or injury to
                any person lawfully employed, or danger to human life, health or safety,
                or a disturbance of the public tranquility, or a riot, or an affray.
                This order has to be in written form and state material circumstances
                due to which the power is being invoked.</p>
            <p>The constitutional validity of passing an internet shutdown order

                read into certain procedural safeguards in the

                The court, further, observed that
                the principle of proportionality is applicable on these orders and the
                authority must adopt the least restrictive measure. Which means that the
                issuing authority has to balance the security interest of the state and
                individuals rights.</p>
            <p>The court observed that “<em>in a situation where the fundamental
                rights of the citizens are being curtailed, the same cannot be done
                through an arbitrary exercise of power; rather it should be based</em>
                <em>on objective facts. The preventive/remedial measures under Section
                    144, Cr.P.C. should be based on the type of exigency, extent of
                    territoriality, nature of restriction and the duration of the

                that where a special
                law exists, the application of the general law is precluded.
                Accordingly, the application of Section 144 for the purposes of imposing
                internet shutdowns becomes questionable.</p>

                Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 prescribes the procedure for suspension of
                telecommunication services.</p>
            <p>According to these Rules the power to impose an internet shutdown is
                with the executive branch of the union and state. As per sub rule 2(6),
                an internet shutdown shall be imposed in accordance with Section 5(2) of
                the Indian Telegraph Act. Section 5(2) states that an internet shutdown
                can be imposed only in case of a “public emergency” or in the interest
                of “public safety”. However,
                <strong>
                    these terms (public emergency
                    and public safety) have not been defined anywhere in the parent act

                imposed in situations which do not satisfy the threshold of a public
                emergency or public safety as laid down by judicial precedents.<span class="footnote" id="37">

                Such instances violate fundamental rights of freedom of speech, press

            <p>Further in the landmark judgement of
                <em>

                        Union of India</strong>
                </em>
                the court observed that “<em>we think it
                    necessary to reiterate that complete broad suspension of telecom
                    services, be it the Internet or otherwise, being a drastic measure,</em>
                <em>
                    <strong>must be considered by the State only if ‘necessary’ and
                        ‘unavoidable</strong>

            </p>
            <p>However, we have observed this condition being violated by state
                governments at multiple instances. For example, Internet shutdowns were
                imposed by Rajasthan state to prevent cheating in exams three times in a
                month despite submitting before the High Court of Rajasthan that it
                shall not impose internet shutdown to prevent cheating in exams.<span class="footnote" id="41">

            <p>In addition to that, the rules provide for formation of a review
                committee at the central and state level. The task of this committee is
                <em>only</em>
                to determine whether an internet shutdown was imposed
                according to the law. Further, the Review Committee is composed of
                members from the executive branch.<span class="footnote" id="43">

                This means that the
                committee is not independent and lacks diversity in its composition. In
                addition, it is a violation of principles of natural justice.
                <strong>Such a mechanism of review has resulted in no accountability and
                    transparency in relation to imposition of internet shutdowns.</strong>
                <strong>Further, we sparingly see the minutes of the meetings as
                    Government often claim exemptions under Section 8A or 24(4) of the RTI
                    Act. However, from the reports that we have seen, the orders are usually
                    copy pasted and do not reflect application of mind.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>In a recent report by the parliamentary Standing Committee on
                Communications and Information Technology, it was submitted by the
                government of India that there exists no official centralized record of
                the states which have constituted functioning review committees or
                not.<span class="footnote" id="44">

            <p>Moreover, in the case of
                <em>
                    <strong>Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of
                        India</strong>
                </em>, it was held by the Supreme Court of India that an
                internet shutdown order passed under the Rules must be published and
                made publicly available. As an internet shutdown is a restriction on
                fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) and 19(1)(g)
                (freedom of speech and expression; and freedom to trade and profession).
                Therefore, it will be a violation of principles of natural justice if an
                internet shutdown order is not publicly available for citizens to
                challenge the suspension.<span class="footnote" id="45">

              </span>
                However, it has been
                observed by us that very often states fail to make internet shutdown
                orders publicly available. These are then obtained through RTI
                applications. This results in losing out on time and the ability to
                challenge an internet shutdown while it is in place and seek restoration
                of internet.</p>
            <p>SFLC.in has also written to state governments on various occasions

                Telecommunication Bill, 2022
            </h3>
            
            <p>The Department of Telecommunications introduced the Draft
                Telecommunication Bill, 2022 (hereinafter “the Draft Bill”) on
                21<sup>st</sup>
                September, 2022.<span class="footnote" id="48">
                The Draft Telecommunication Bill, 2022.
            </span>
                The government intends
                to replace the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 with the Bill. As noted above,
                currently the governing legislation for Internet Shutdowns in India is
                the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 read with the Rules. Clause 24(1)(a) of
                the Draft Bill prescribes the conditions and procedure for suspension of
                telecommunication services. The clause borrows heavily from its
                predecessor. It continues to use the terms public emergency and public
                safety without putting any definitional limits on them. Pertinently,
                clause 53 of the Draft Bill states that All rules, guidelines or
                administrative orders, made or purported to have been made under the
                Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 shall continue to remain in force unless they
                are superseded by rules made under the Draft Bill. Therefore, the
                Telecom Suspension Rules will continue to be force till new rules are
                introduced by the government.</p>
            <h3>
                Challenges for Documentation
            </h3>
            <p>Several challenges arise while tracking and documenting internet
                shutdowns due to lapses by the executing agencies in following the
                prescribed procedure. These challenges are not only limited to recording
                a shutdown. Documentation of adverse impact of internet shutdowns on
                freedom of speech and press, freedom of trade, education and health are
                significantly harder as communication becomes difficult during such
                outages. SFLC.in attempts to document the shutdowns and impact through
                the tracker and the Lost Voices project. However, we would like to
                highlight the challenges faced, especially while filing applications
                under the RTI Act.</p>
            
            <h3>Non Publication of Orders</h3>
            
            <p>Many a times orders are not published before an internet shutdown is
                imposed. In the month of May a 7 day long internet shutdown was imposed
                with publishing a notification. These suspensions are also extended in
                terms of duration and geographical extent without notifications, for
                instance during Bihar internet suspension the extent of shutdown was
                increased from 12 districts to 20 without issuing any notification.
                Resultantly, difficulty in keeping a track of these shutdowns and
                challenging them is increased significantly.</p>
            
            <h3>Applications under the RTI Act</h3>
            
            <p>Applications under the Right to Information Act, 2005 are regularly
                filed to obtain orders directing suspension of the internet, formation
                of Review Committee under the Telecom Suspension Rules and minutes of
                meeting of the Review Committees. Two significant challenges which are
                faced while documenting are:</p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>
                    <p>State governments claim blanket exemption under section 8(1)(a)
                        of the RTI Act and refuse to provide all the suspension orders. Section
                        8 of the Act allows Public Information Officer to deny such information
                        which will prejudicially affect the sovereignty and integrity of India,
                        the security, strategic, scientific or economic interests of the State,
                        relation with foreign State or lead to incitement of an offence. So far
                        from the responses received Jharkhand and Assam state governments have
                        sought this exemption under section 8(1)(a) to refuse providing
                        orders.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Additionally, state governments have exempted certain branches of
                        their Home Departments under section 24 of the Right to Information Act,
                        2005. Section 24 of the Act provides the State Government may exempt
                        certain organisations from being under the ambit of the Act through a
                        notification issued in the Official Gazette. Pursuant to which the Home
                        Departments of Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, have denied providing suspension
                        orders as the branch issuing the suspension order is exempted from the
                        Act.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>This gives rise to a conflict between the law laid down by the
                Supreme Court of India in
                <em>
                    <strong>Anuradha Bhasin</strong>
                </em>
                and
                Right to Information Act, 2005. Section 22 of the Right to Information
                Act, 2005 gives an over-riding effect to the Act. However, such blanket
                exemptions lead to violation of Principles of Natural Justice. As
                observed by the Supreme Court, access to internet is a fundamental right
                as far as it acts as a medium to access fundamental rights such as
                freedom of speech and expression and freedom of trade. Thus, non
                publication of these orders and the denial to provide them under the RTI
                Act is a violation of Principle of Natural Justice.</p>
            <p>The table in Annexure 1 provides the number of applications that were
                filed and the responses received paints the complete picture to
                understand the issues highlighted above.</p>

                    <p>The Writ Petition was filed challenging the imposition of internet
                        shutdowns in various districts in the state of Haryana. On 27.01.2021,
                        internet was initially suspended in the districts of Jhajjhar, Sonipat
                        and Palwal. The initial shutdown was to last till 5 pm on 27.02.2021 but
                        it was subsequently extended till 5 pm on 28.01.2021. Subsequently, the
                        internet shutdown was arbitrarily extended to a total of 17 districts.
                        The shutdown was completely lifted on 06.02.2021, after a period of more
                        than 10 days. The Petition prayed for quashing of the order imposing the
                        internet shutdown. It further prayed for constituting a committee of
                        government officials, representatives from the civil society, economists
                        and independent policy professionals to study the economic impact of the

                <em>Stakeholder Mapping</em>
            </h2>
            <p>Obstruction of access to internet in present times, when internet is
                the currency to access services and exercise rights, has scathing
                effects on the entire social order and ecosystem. In order to accurately
                assess the role which each societal stakeholder which affects, and gets
                affected in the chain of causality during an internet shutdown, this
                chapter of the Report conducts a two part mapping exercise. First, the
                concerned stakeholders are identified with a brief analysis of the role
                of and impact on each of them when a shutdown is imposed. This is
                followed by charting the chain of causality when an internet shutdown is
                ordered, and how SFLC.in interacts with each of them when access to
                internet is throttled.</p>
            <h3>
                Citizens and the Society
            </h3>
            <p>Internet shutdowns have overt tangible and intangible impact on
                citizens and the society. Reference may be made to Chapter 2 of this
                Report, which elaborates on the kind of fallouts from internet shutdowns
                suffered by the citizen, and the effect it has on the society and its
                economy.</p>
            <h3>
                The Central and State Governments
            </h3>
            <p>By law, the Central and State Governments are authorized to imposed
                internet shutdowns. The process of exercise of this power has been laid
                out in this Report in Chapter 3. The Chapter also elaborates on issues
                such as absence of due process requirements, and weak transparency and
                accountability measures in the concerned statutes, which concentrate
                Executive discretion without legal check posts. By virtue of this power,
                the Governments effectively become arbiters of freedom of speech and
                expression upon the suspension of internet services. Furthermore, relief
                against internet shutdowns can, in most cases, only be
                <em>ex post</em>.
                    There is a greater burden on the Governments to exercise discretion and
                    judiciousness while wielding the power to block communications over the
                    internet.</p>
            <h3>
                Judiciary
            </h3>
            <p>Courts, as the organ of the State with inherent powers to curb
                Executive excess, have played an increasingly important role in ensuring
                accountability of the Executive when internet shutdown orders are
                issued. Chapter 4 of this Report traces the role of the judiciary as an
                accessible forum for citizens to press their rights against arbitrary
                internet shutdowns and their damaging consequences.</p>
            <p>To provide a brief insight, it is noted that before the
                <em>
                    <strong>Anuradha Bhasin</strong>
                </em>
                judgement, the Temporary
                Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety)
                Rules, 2017 suffered from a lack of procedural safeguards. The judgement
                expanded upon the requirements that needed to be fulfilled for a valid
                internet shutdown. The decision has weighed the right to information of
                citizens over the suppression of orders by the governments. Furthermore,
                the Court examined the role of the
                <em>District Magistrate</em>
                and laid

                judicial review. But most importantly, it read in the principles of
                necessity, legitimacy, proportionally as well as recourse to judicial
                review. Furthermore, it was a three judge bench of the Supreme Court of
                India which ordered for the constitution of a Special Committee to
                review internet shutdown<span class="footnote" id="55">

            <p>The establishment of strong precedents protecting the individual’s
                right of access to internet against arbitrary shutdowns has provided the
                first line of defense against rights-abuse. Courts, by their very
                structure and placement in the Constitution, become the instruments to
                hold the Government accountable.</p>
            <h3>Civil Society Organisations</em>
            </h3>
            <p>Civil Society organisations are responsible to form the first line of
                resistance against Government inaction and oppressive actions. Human
                rights organisations, non-governmental organisations, digital rights
                organisations, and independent activists offer a medium between the
                State and the citizens. They reach out to the government with policy
                recommendations and at the same time, make available resources to the
                citizens about their rights, proactively defend the rights and provide
                open-source resources on governmental policies. The United Nations Human
                Rights Office of High Commissioner has observed that civil societies are
                responsible for networking with other interested organisations in the
                face of a shutdown, presentation of reports and making it available to
                the public and insisting the State to justify the shutdown with valid
                paperwork as well as challenging the shutdowns<span class="footnote" id="56">

            <p>As the medium which bears the responsibility of creating awareness
                among citizens about their rights, and amplifies their concerns, civil
                societies play the role of the watchdog. Their persistent and unified
                efforts are key in ensuring accountability of the State in the exercise
                of its powers.</p>

            <p>The information commissions at different levels act as repositories
                of information, accessible to almost all of the stakeholders above.
                Information which may not be available in the public domain about
                internet shutdowns, is made available through applications under the RTI
                Act. As mentioned in Chapter 1, the RTI procedure has been used by
                SFLC.in to collect information and maintain vigilance about internet
                shutdowns. In effect, it helps keep track of the steps taken by
                governments for protection of one’s freedoms, and to formulate policy
                recommendations based on the information that is procured.</p>
            <p>Access to such information being fundamental to ensuring
                accountability of the Government, the need for absolute transparency and
                cooperation from information commissions is fundamental in defending
                human rights violated through shutdowns.</p>

            <p>Internet shutdown orders are issued by the Government to
                telecommunication companies and internet service providers under the
                provisions mentioned earlier in this Report. Upon receiving such orders,
                service providers suspend internet services on their networks. Shutdowns
                affect these organisations economically, since the orders prohibit the
                rendering of services to their customers. The United Nations Guiding
                Principles on Business and Human Rights has been read by UN OHCHR, to
                put responsibilities on the companies to challenge the shutdowns,

                communication, investigation and verification of news, especially in
                politically affected areas where opaque governance orders are issued.
                During internet shutdowns, media is disrupted due to non-dissemination
                of information and prohibitions on distribution of information. In the
                Bhasin case, the Court recognized that restrictions on communication
                affects freedom of press and is a violation of freedom of speech and
                expression. Disruptions in access to the internet inherently affects
                dissemination of information and encourages distribution of
                misinformation in absence of verified sources which has become a huge
                issue in Kashmir.<span class="footnote" id="58">

                It also leads to suppression of
                otherwise relevant information by the government and prevents
                journalistic endeavours into potential human rights violations as well.
                As watchdogs of the society, media houses also play a significant role

            <p>Parliamentarians, as agents elected by the society to hold the

                Through parliamentary procedures like Question Hour in the Houses of
                Parliament and through Parliamentary Committees, Members of Parliament
                are in a unique position to highlight the duress of the people due to
                arbitrary internet shutdowns, and campaign for more rights-respecting

                <em>Way Forward and Conclusion</em>
            </h2>
            <p>The observations made in this Report make emphatically clear the
                failings of the current legal framework in defending human rights in the
                context of access to the internet. As seen in the Report, the disruption
                of access to the internet is triggered at the most menial of instances,
                including for reasons where alternatives to internet shutdowns are
                available. The glaring absence of necessity, rationality,
                proportionality, and due process in the exercise of shutdown powers has
                attracted significant disrepute to the state of democracy in India.</p>
            <p>It was expected that the sustained vocalization of national and
                international concerns about the internet shutdown regime in India would
                invite the attention of lawmakers to the due process and accountability
                issues in the law as it stands. However, the introduction of the draft
                Indian Telecommunications Bill, 2022 bears no reprieve.</p>
            <p>As suggested in our comments to the Government on suggested changes
                to the draft Bill, which is likely to be the statute which will empower
                the Government to impose internet shutdowns, we recommend that the terms
                “public safety” and “public emergency” be legislatively defined. These
                terms, which will act as grounds for internet suspension as per the
                draft Bill, enable Executive excess and discretion which is violative of
                both substantive and procedural due process. Defining these terms, in
                keeping with the judgement of the Supreme Court of India in PUCL v.
                Union of India<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref">
                    <sup>59</sup>
                </a> is crucial to ensuring that the
                provisions are not misused. More specifically, reference is made to the
                observations of the Second Press Commission, which was relied on by the
                Supreme Court in the above-mentioned case. The Commission
                recommended additional safeguards, since the existence of 'public
                emergency’ is a non-objective fact. It was recommended that the
                existence of a public emergency must first be declared by the Government
                “by a notification warranting the exercise of this power and it is only
                after the issue of such a notification warranting the exercise of this
                power and it is only after the issue of such a notification” that the
                powers should be exercised by the delegated authority. It was deemed
                appropriate in their recommendation that the delegated authority should
                be a District Magistrate, who upon receiving such a notification, may
                pass an appropriate order. Although these recommendations were made in
                the context of the provision of the Telegraph Act which allowed the
                withholding of transmission of messages, we submit that these
                recommendations apply in the context of this provision as well.</p>
            <p>It is accordingly recommended, that a public emergency must only be
                deemed to have occurred if a notification is published by the Government
                to that effect. Only when such an emergency has occurred, can the
                subsequent notification be passed which allows the Government to take
                temporary possession. Furthermore, the terms ‘public emergency’ and
                ‘public safety’ continue to remain undefined, despite the Supreme
                Court’s enunciation of the same in 1996. It would be most opportune to
                give legislative effect to those definitions. It is accordingly
                recommended that the following definitions of the terms, as propounded
                by the Supreme Court in the 1996 case, be added to Section 2 of the
                proposed Bill:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Public Emergency: “Public emergency would mean the prevailing of a
                    sudden condition or state of affairs affecting the people at large
                    calling for immediate action”;</p>
                <p>Public Safety: “The expression “public safety” means the state or
                    condition of freedom from danger or risk for the people at large”.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>It also bears mentioning that there is an absence of a requirement on
                the part of the State to exercise proportionality while issuing shutdown
                orders. As mentioned in this Report, the interruption of internet
                services obstructs the exercise of fundamental rights of affected
                citizens. A legislative mandate of proportionality while issuing
                shutdown orders can compel application of mind on the part of the
                officers who will issue the shutdown orders, and advocate for an active
                effort to prioritize rights.</p>
            <p>From Chapter 3 of this Report, which mentions the Review Committee
                put in place to scrutinize shutdown orders, it may be observed that the
                Committee has a glaring absence of judicial members who can confirm the
                legality or illegality of an order which has been passed. By
                recommending the inclusion of judicial members in the Review process,
                SFLC.in proposes another layer of accountability, to ensure adequate
                checks over an otherwise purely Executive exercise.</p>
            <p>As mentioned in the Report, there are several challenges faced in
                documenting internet shutdowns. Transparency on this front is crucial to
                be able to identify the various instances where the State exercises its
                prerogative at the cost of rights. In order to alleviate this issue, it
                is also recommended that as a central repository be maintained by the
                Governments, accounting for each internet shutdown which has been
                imposed. This will allow an accurate study of the frequency and
                intensity of internet shutdowns, and their impact.</p>
            <p>We further the recommendation of the Parliamentary Standing Committee
                on Information Technology that an impact assessment exercise be
                conducted by the Government “to properly assess the effectiveness of
                such drastic measures in controlling situations of public emergency and
                public safety.” As stated by the Committee, the assumption of the State
                that these shutdowns are effective in achieving their desired objective
                of maintaining law and order, must be backed empirically.</p>
            <p>The interests of the people require that decision-makers of
                the day take into account the above action-points, and in keeping with
                our Constitutional ideals, introduce mechanisms to safeguard rights
                against arbitrary internet shutdowns.</p>
